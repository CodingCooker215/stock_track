# stock_track
Very quick project I did (less than an hour) to track my current stock profits. 

Uses bubble sort to sort algo (I know it's not the most efficient but it works well for my purposes)

Does not work for stocks NOT on yahoo finance, need to do 
  pip install yfinance
this PIP install allows program to access ticker from Yahoo fiance. Certain stocks of companies NOT in the United States are not included so not complete
I will most likely NOT be modifying this program
